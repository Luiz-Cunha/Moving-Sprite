## Interactive Chicken Animation

This JavaScript project features an interactive chicken animation. The chicken responds dynamically to cursor movements: it runs away when the cursor gets close, and moves towards the cursor when it remains stationary some time. This engaging behavior is implemented using a canvas element.

### Features

- **Responsive Chicken Animation**: The chicken changes direction based on the cursor's position.
- **Canvas Rendering**: The chicken sprite is rendered using the HTML5 canvas for smooth animation.

### Technical Details

- **JavaScript**: Core logic for cursor detection and movement.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the chicken sprite.
